# Public-CyberProjects

This repositiory is just to hold some new projects I'm currently working on.

When it comes to computer programming classes, I've already been through these 

Intro to comp sci I & II -> Data Structures and algorithms I & II -> Computer systems I & II
(python) -> (Java) --> (C++, C, and Assembly)


But as of February 2023, I'm in a Python Cybersecurity class and I plan on leveraging what i'm learning there and want to make more projects.

I've already uploaded a Directory and subdomain enumerator which were little projects for me to warm up for the class. 
I plan on making those programs even better with more features and soon upload a port scanner I've been working on.
